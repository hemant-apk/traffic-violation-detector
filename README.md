## üß† How It Works

1. The system **watches the entire video** to understand the environment and traffic flow.
2. It then **revisits the video**, frame by frame, to detect possible violations.
3. For each detected violation, it logs:
   - What happened (violation type)
   - Who was involved (e.g., ‚Äúred hatchback‚Äù, ‚Äúpedestrian in black shirt‚Äù)
   - When it happened (timestamp)
4. It generates a structured report in:
   - `JSON` format for programmatic use

5. Real-time **violation alerts** are overlaid directly onto the video output.
